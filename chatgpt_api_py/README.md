### This Django app (chatgpt_api_py) uses Python Library "module" openai

This is a "pure" JavaScript solution to access OpenAI.com ChatGPT API.

This app (chatgpt_api_py) uses openai Python library module, instead of "mostly pure"
JavaScript approach in app chatgpt_api_js. This should be much simpler to use, provided
it gives comparable results as in chatgpt_api_js.

It will be interesting to see how much easier this is--probably the way I will choose
for normal Django site to use OpenAI interface.
