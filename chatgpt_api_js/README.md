### This Django app (chatgpt_api_js) is Based on Treehouse course

This is a "pure" JavaScript solution to access OpenAI.com ChatGPT API.
I will probably never use this method, but I should experiment with it.
But the Python openai module is (probably) the better solution (chaptgpt_api_py).

WARNING: This is not very pretty. I do not want to have to use "pure javascript" solution
if I am to use the Django framework. BUT THIS APP IS PROBABLY HIGHLY USEFUL IN SEEING WHAT
IT TAKES TO DIRECTLY INTERFACE WITH OPENAI API (in this case, the ChatGPT API).

ALSO be aware: ChatGPT 3.5 turbo will be deprecated ~2024. You may need to use a different,
updated API in the future. 11/5/23 cdk
